# Intro
This project is meant to explain problems and solutions related to questions that appear normally during interviews


## Stacks and Queues
##### Question 1
How would you use a single array to implement three stacks?
Solution: [FixedMultiStack](/src/main/java/StacksandQueues/FixedMultiStack.java)
Test: [FixedMultiStackTest](/src/main/java/StacksandQueues/FixedMultiStackTest.java)

##### Question 2
How would you design a stack  which in addition to push and pop, has a function min which returns the minimum element? All should operate in O(1)
[Coming soon]

##### Question 3
Implement a queue class using two stacks
Solution: [MyCustomQueue](/src/main/java/StacksandQueues/MyCustomQueue.java)
Test: [MyCustomQueueTest](/src/main/java/StacksandQueues/MyCustomQueueTest.java)
